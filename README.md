# Project Information
My very first project via github, Might contain bad commit history as I lost a lot of files, over and over again so beware of bad commit history, as I had to do a lot of copy n paste.


# Technology
This Project was written in HTML, CSS, Gitpod, hosted via Github


# Special thanks to:
